# udacity-personal-blog-website

A personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling

### Usage

---

Once all files are downloaded, open index.html file by dropping in an open browser window.

Because this is a demo site, none of the links trigger any actions, with the exception of two:

1. "Steve's Blog" title in the top left corner will return the user to the homepage when visiting the blog post page.
2. The "read more" link within first blog post card listed on the homepage entitled, "The Wild Flowers in a field" will send the user to the blog post page.
