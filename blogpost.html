            <div class="main-content-article-content"><p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Just let thes e leaves jump off the pedal.</p>
              <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Happy painting, God bless. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>
              <p></p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Take your time. Speed will come later. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Let's have a happy little tree in here. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. You can do it. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Just make a decision and let it go.</p>
              <p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>
